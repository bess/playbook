# Meeting Etiquette

Most of the time we are working remotely from each other and from clients. In order to make our time as productive as possible, we ask that team members observe the following meeting etiquette rules.

1. *Arrive early for meetings and test connectivity beforehand.* It's not a good use of anyone's time to spend the first part of the meeting saying "Can you hear me now?"

1. *Have a connection backup ready.* Internet outages can happen unexpectedly, and you should have a plan B for Internet connectivity. Whether it's using your cell phone or a subscription service (some of us like [SkyRoam](http://www.skyroam.com/)), have it at hand and know how to use it so you can recover quickly.

1. *Choose your location to minimize noise and distraction.* Obviously things beyond our control can sometimes happen, but whenever possible expect to work from a location with minimal background noise.

1. *Use noise canceling technology whenever possible.* The audio quality of your conversations will be greatly improved if you invest in a good quality headset or noise-canceling speakerphone. Many of us really like [this speaker phone](https://smile.amazon.com/Sennheiser-TW9094-SP20-Mobile-Speakerphone/dp/B00K2RQ94C/ref=sr_1_3?crid=AA4D0A93RJHE&keywords=sennheiser+speakerphone&qid=1562178875&s=gateway&sprefix=senheiser+speak%2Caps%2C195&sr=8-3) specifically.

1. *Provide good quality video of yourself whenever possible.* It helps us gel as a team, and helps our clients connect with us, if we can attach a face to your voice and pick up on non-verbal communication. Ideally, your face should be well lit and directly facing the camera. Investing in a good camera helps tremendously here. [Some of us like a Razer Kiyo for this](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B075N1BYWB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
